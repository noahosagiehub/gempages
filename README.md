     - Don't expect apologies from the customer even when they are wrong (but it doesn't mean you should let them walk over you)
     - You can be empathy and stand your ground when you deal with abusive or difficult customers
   - Give people the benefit of doubt
   - Make customers a part of the solution
     - In situations when the product or services might not have been built to solve that customer's problem but they might be expecting it, ask then what they think the right solutuin is
     - This will give them a chance to put themselves in your shoes instead of being against you
   - Be curious about your customer
     - Customers hate being trated like they have been figured out when they never had a change to explain
     - Expressing curiosity about what the customer is doing and how they came to face that particular problem will go a long way - makes it easier to talk to
   - Look for common interest
     - Take some effort to build a bond with customers
     - Did you notice that their desktop image is that of your favorite band?
     - Having more in common can make both parties understand each other more

   - Always greet the customer with their name. Don't put them down even when the conversation is taking a bad turn
   - Be extra careful when there is a language barrier
   - Respond to the customer's tone
   - Do not assume, ask
     - Always ask them if they have already done that and show that you are willing to troubleshoot further.
     - This prevents resolution from been delayed and making the customer feel like they are rushed
   - Take thei side when they are right
     - When they are right and the fault is on your company's side, go ahead and say "You're right". We messed up."
     - Customer will respect your company for it for such statements. They will understand that you truly value your ustomers' opinion
   - Avoid sympathyInstead of saying, "That must be frustrating", try saying "I understand how frustrating that is."
     - Being more personal also helps, instead of saying "The team will resolve this issue soon", try saying "I am working with the team to solve this issue soon"

     - Every time you assume something about someone when there is no data to support it, contemplate and find out if that was because of a bias
   - Maintain positivity
     - A good way to stay positive is by observing for a week and noting down the times you feel a positive or a negative emotion and the events that trigger it

       - Educational background, age, comapny, organization structure, etc.
     This helps bridge the gap and cultivate empathy
